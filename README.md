### ðŸš™ The ongoing portfolio journey
Since my first coding class as a sophomore in highschool, I have had the need to design and build a portfolio showcasing my work and projects. Since 2013, I have molded and crafted that original website to what it is today. This is in no way the last portfolio i'll make, but it stands as the current state of work that I am doing.
